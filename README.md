# Housing Data Regression

Practice using tensorflow to produce the simplest of regression models
over a common reference dataset.  I'm using the housing datafile
found in ex1 of https://github.com/amaas/stanford_dl_ex.

## Purpose

Take a dataset normally used for learning how to write one's own linear
regression model and use it to exercise tensorflow in a simple setting.
More intended to become more comfortable with the API than for
actual generalization.

## Organization

All the code is in the ipython notebook itself, but the analysis
can be viewed more simply by just opening the HTML file in the root of this project
